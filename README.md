# Test Driven Development Examples
Examples from Test-Driven Development By Example by Kent Beck, in typescript.

Each commit is one step in the TDD process, as shown in the book. To view only commits related to a specific part or chapter, checkout the related branch.

## Setup
To get started, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

### Part 1
Run tests with `npm run test:part1` or `npm run test:part1:dev` to automatically run tests after new changes.

### Part 2
"Part 2: The xUnit Problem" involves creating our own testing framework, so has separate commands to run the tests that don't use mocha.

Run the tests with `npm run test:part2` or `npm run test:part2:dev` to automatically run tests after new changes.
